==========================================

AAres is a tool for reduction of 2D data collected in a small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiment, typically on isotropic samples like liquids or powders. The tool supports batch data collection (e.g. one file per sample) or time series like SEC-SAXS experiments with protein samples.

AAres was developed to work with SAXSpoint 2.0 (Anton Paar) instrument, but the design allows simple adaptation to other instruments if data are stored in HDF5 and the experiment is reasonably described within.
